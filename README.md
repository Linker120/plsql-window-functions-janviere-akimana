#  PL/SQL Window Functions â€“ Coffee Distribution Analysis

STEP1.##  Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **PL/SQL window functions** to analyze sales and customer behavior for a coffee distribution company operating across regions (Kigali, Bugesera, Musanze). The analysis supports **marketing strategies** and **inventory planning** by identifying sales trends, top-performing products, and customer segments.

##  Business Problem
**Business Context**  
A coffee distribution company operating across multiple regions (Kigali, Bugesera, and Musanze) aims to enhance decision-making by leveraging sales and customer data. The company manages a wide range of products and serves a diverse customer base in these regions.

**Data Challenge**  
Although the company records thousands of transactions, it lacks actionable insights into which products perform best in each region, seasonal purchasing patterns, and how customer behavior evolves over time. Without these insights, both marketing strategies and inventory planning remain inefficient.

**Expected Outcome**  
The analysis will provide a clear view of top-selling products by region, identify sales growth trends, and segment customers into meaningful groups. These insights will guide targeted marketing campaigns, improve inventory management, and support data-driven decision-making for business growth.

STEP2.##  Success Criteria
This project implements **five measurable goals** using window functions:

1. Top 5 Products per Region/Quarter â†’ RANK()
   
Meaning: Ranking within groups. This function assigns a numerical rank (1, 2, 3...) to rows based on a value (like sales), but the ranking restarts every time a new group begins (like a new region or a new quarter).

Simple Analogy: It's like finding out who placed 1st, 2nd, and 3rd in each individual race at a track meet, not in the whole competition.

2. Running Monthly Sales Totals â†’ SUM() OVER()
   
Meaning: A growing total. This calculates a cumulative sum where the total for any given month includes the sales from that month plus the total from all previous months. The window of data being added up just keeps getting bigger.

Simple Analogy: It's keeping a running balance in your checking account. The current balance is the sum of every transaction since the account opened.

3. Month-over-Month Growth (%) â†’ LAG() / LEAD()
   
Meaning: Looking backward or forward. These functions let you look at the data from a previous row (LAG()) or a next row (LEAD()) without doing a complex join. This is essential for comparing the current period's value (like sales) to the last period's value to calculate growth. 

4. **Customer quartiles (segmentation)** â†’ `NTILE(4)`
   
Meaning: Splitting data into equal buckets. This function divides all your rows (like customers) into a specified number of equally-sized groups or "tiles" based on some ordered metric (like how much they spend). NTILE(4) specifically creates four quartiles (Top 25%, next 25%, etc.).
   
5. **3-month moving averages** â†’ `AVG() OVER()`
     
Meaning: Smoothing out the data. This calculates an average, but instead of using all the data, it uses a small, defined, sliding window of rows. A 3-month moving average calculates the average sales for the current month plus the two previous months.

STEP3.##  Database Schema

### Customers Table

![ER Diagram customers](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4545338-266b-411d-968c-1cacc111e71b)

### Products Table

### Transactions Table

![ER Diagram transactions](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17979610-6ba0-433d-8cce-6a8f7435288b)

This schema tracks transactions involving animal-related products and customers. It includes three main tables:
CUSTOMERS: Stores customer details like ID, name, and region.
PRODUCTS: Contains product information including ID, name, and price.
TRANSACTIONS: Records each transaction with fields for transaction ID, customer ID, product ID, date, and amount.
 Relationships:
- Each transaction links to one customer and one product using foreign keys.

STEP4.##  Window Functions Implementation

### 1. Ranking â€“ Top Products per Region
This query calculates the total revenue per customer and applies different ranking functions. RANK() assigns positions but leaves gaps if ties exist, DENSE_RANK() avoids gaps, ROW_NUMBER() gives unique sequential numbers, and PERCENT_RANK() shows percentile ranking.

![ranking](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bae2c737-6b90-495b-a771-ece3aae30088)

---

### 2. Aggregate â€“ Running Monthly Sales Totals
SUM() OVER (...) gives a running total of sales per customer across time. AVG() OVER (...) with a frame calculates a 3-row moving average, useful for smoothing trends.

### 3. Navigation â€“ Month-over-Month Growth
LAG() looks at the previous monthâ€™s sales, and LEAD() looks at the next monthâ€™s sales. This allows you to compare a customerâ€™s sales from one month to another

### 4. Distribution â€“ Customer Quartiles
NTILE(4) divides customers into 4 revenue-based groups (quartiles). CUME_DIST() shows the cumulative distribution position of each customer in the revenue ranking.

##  Results Analysis

**Descriptive (What happened?)**  
- Kigali generated the highest sales consistently.  
- Sales peaked in March 2024.  
- Top products differed by region.  

**Diagnostic (Why?)**  
- Kigali had more high-value repeat customers.  
- Bugesera demand dropped due to fewer promotions.  
- March spike was linked to seasonal promotions.  

**Prescriptive (What next?)**  
- Increase promotions in Bugesera.  
- Stock more top products in Kigali.  
- Use quartile segmentation for loyalty programs.  
- Monitor moving averages for better forecasting.
